This repository contains assorted example projects for libopencm3.

The libopencm3 project aims to create an open-source firmware library for
various ARM Cortex-M3 microcontrollers.

For more information visit http://libopencm3.org

The examples are meant as starting points for different subsystems on multitude
of platforms.

Feel free to add new examples and send them to us either via the mailinglist or
preferably via a github pull request.

Usage
-----

The makefiles are generally useable for your own projects with
only minimal changes for the libopencm3 install path (See Installation)

For flashing the 'miniblink' example (after you built libopencm3 and the
examples by typing 'make' at the top-level directory) onto the Olimex
STM32-H103 eval board (ST STM32F1 series microcontroller), you can execute:

 $ cd examples/stm32/f1/stm32-h103/miniblink
 $ make flash

The Makefiles of the examples are configured to use a certain OpenOCD
flash programmer, you might need to change some of the variables in the
Makefile if you use a different one.

You can also flash manually like this:

 $ openocd -f interface/jtagkey-tiny.cfg -f target/stm32f1x.cfg
 $ telnet localhost 4444
 > reset halt
 > flash write_image erase foobar.hex
 > reset

Replace the "jtagkey-tiny.cfg" with whatever JTAG device you are using, and/or
replace "stm32f1x.cfg" with your respective config file. Replace "foobar.hex"
with the file name of the image you want to flash.
