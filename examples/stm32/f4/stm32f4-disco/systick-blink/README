Systick Blink
-------------

This version of blink is slightly more sophisticated, it shows how you
can initialize the Cortex M SYSTICK register to give a regular interrupt.
It adds a function for doing precise delays. The original blink code
is then rewritten with this in mind to create a 10Hz blinking pattern.
